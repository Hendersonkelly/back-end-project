##About the Project:
Our web dev class was tasked with creating a full-stack project (with emphasis on back end). We decided to create a version of Bumble/Hinge, but for dog owners looking for a playmate for their pups. Fetch a Friend allows a user to create an account, set up a profile for their dog, and search for other dogs by zipcode.  The dog profiles include criteria such as size, energy level, and description so that the owner can identify a suitable match.  Then owners can message each other to set up playdates.

If you are a new registrant, you will be directed to a profile creation page:

If you are a returning user, you will be directed to a dashboard which displays your dog(s) information:

You can then access the Dog Search, to look at profiles of the other dogs in our database. You can filter by zipcode, if you'd like to search for dogs in a specific area.
